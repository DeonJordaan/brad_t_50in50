# Brad Traversy 50-in-50

This repo holds the code for the completed practice projects I've built as part of [Brad Traversy's](https://www.traversymedia.com/) [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/) course on Udemy.
In stead of steamrolling through the course, I use it intermittently to revise what I've learnt about JavaScript and to give me a deeper understanding of how the language can be applied.
